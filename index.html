    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>So, you want to read my bio in prose.</p>
    <p>I'd bet you want it in a basic no-frills website as well. So here you go, this is a plain and simple page with exactly what you want and nothing else, written with absolutely no effort and completed in 5 minutes.</p>
    <h2>How I will describe myself in 4 words</h2>
    <p>Analytic, resourceful, curious, tactful</p>
    <h2>My skllls</h2>
    <p>
      I have been programming for about 10 years, in several languages. I am most comfortable with TypeScript and Python, since these are the languages used by the companies I have worked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expertise is in the frontend (which you are missing out on, by the way), and I am familiar with are React and Vue. For backend I am experienced in Node.js. Database solutions I am familiar with are PostgreSQL and Firebase. I have competitive programming experience in C++ and Java as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also written a number of scripts for both school projects and for fun. I used Python with the Mediapipe library to do gait analysis for a school project, C++ for several school projects involving Arduino. I also used PyTorch to demonstrate Monte Carlo photon diffusion simulation to my professor and classmates. I have also used VBA for various tasks during my internship at SingHealth.
    </p>
    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
    <h2>Projects and Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I have written a number of projects and about 3.5 years of internship experience working in technical roles. You can read the briefs on these projects on this site, and you can also find some of my thoughts over at dev blogs.
    </p>
    <h2>Working Rights</h2>
    <p>
      I have been living in Singapore for about 15 years. I am exempted from minimum Employment Pass wages requirement by MOM, having studied under MOE Tuition Grant and thus required to work in Singapore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The catch is that you have to make up your mind by September. If I am hired before then, you can be sure that my EP application will be successful without salary restrictions, but because MOM is only recognizing this letter until then, you will have to offer me a significantly higher salary to sponsor my Employment Pass.
